Write a function to determine the number of bits you'll have to flip to go from integer A to B.

example

A 11101 or 29 
B 01111 or 15

output 2

We can solve this problem using a bit by bit xor between A and B

int a = 0x7;

int b = 0x3;

int xo = a ^ b;

int bitsToFlip = 0;
while(xo != 0) {
    if(xo % 2 != 0)
        bitsToFlip ++;
    xo >>= 1;
}

println("number of bits to flip %d", xo);
