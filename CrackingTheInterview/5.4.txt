Explain what the following code does  (n & (n - 1)) ==  0 

case 1

n = 0100 <- 4 base 10

n2 = n -1 = 0011

0100
0011
-----
0000

case 2

n = 0111 <- 7 base 10

n2 = n -1 = 0110 

0110
0111
-----
0110

4 is a power of 2 but 7 is not.

so if (n & (n - 1)) ==  0 it means that it is a power of 2 or that n = 0
